🧬 Genetic Disorder Prediction Using AI

AI-based classification of rare genetic disorders using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

📄 Overview

This project aims to predict genetic disorders and their subclasses using clinical and phenotype-based medical data.
We implemented multiple machine learning and deep learning models to analyze patient features such as symptoms, inherited gene traits, birth defects, and medical history.
Our best models — Deep Learning & XGBoost — achieved 91% accuracy, proving strong potential for AI-assisted diagnosis.
